# Stats_Exercise_Beer_Ratings
Analyzed distribution of confidence intervals of the rating within each category of beer, using a linear model.Further visualized the distribution of beer ratings within each category of beer. 

Used statistical techniques such as  to answer questions such as: 
1) Does a beer receive a higher rating if it has higher or lower ABV?
2) Does having more sweet and malty elements increase beer rating? 
3) Is there any interaction between the parameters such as ABV, sweetness, etc that effects ratings?

This analysis was conducting using R in Rstudio and the results were visualized by converting Rmakrdown files to html files.
